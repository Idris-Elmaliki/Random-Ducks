# Random-Ducks

About
=====

This app displays a random picture of a duck, alongside a fun fact about ducks with the help of the RandomDuck API.
The main goal of this project is:
  - How to use ViewModel and StateFlow as the glue between the API and the UI
  - Understanding Retrofit and API calling in Jetpack Compose
  - How to send error messsages to the user
  - To Further my knowledge and understanding of coroutines and the Media Player library in Jetpack Compose

Key Info 
-------- 
I just wanted to point out that te main goal for this app was solely the main points mentioned above, so the ui might be a little lackluster.
