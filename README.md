# Random-Ducks

About
=====

This app displays a random picture of a duck, alongside a fun fact about ducks with the help of the *RandomDuck API*.

Main Goal
---------

The main goal of this project is:
  - How to use **ViewModel** and **StateFlow** as the glue between the *Model* and the *Ui* layer
  - Understanding **Retrofit** and API calling in *Jetpack Compose*
  - How to send **Error messsages** to the user
  - Furthering my knowledge and understanding of **Coroutines** and the **Media Player** library in *Jetpack Compose*

Key Info 
-------- 
I just wanted to point out that te main goal for this app was solely the main points mentioned above, so the ui might be a little... lackluster.
So don't get your hopes up and expect the bests of ui.
